    <h4><a name="a1" href="#q1">What is BTCsoccer?</a><h4>
      <p>
      BTCsoccer is a P2P soccer gambling website which takes Bitcoin bets placed on end-results of soccer matches. Multiple bets can be placed per player per match.
      </p>      
      <p>
      Our default & minimum stake per bet is 2mBTC (0.002BTC) but you are free to increase your stakes.
      </p>
      <p>
      The total amount of Bitcoin wagered on a correct end result is automatically transferred and payed out to the winning bettors' Bitcoin addresses.

    <h4><a name="a2" href="#q2">What does a 3% house edge mean?</a><h4>
