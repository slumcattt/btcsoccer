    <h4><a name="a1" href="#q1">What is BTCsoccer?</a><h4>
      <p>
      BTCsoccer is a P2P soccer gambling website which takes Bitcoin bets placed on end-results of soccer matches. Multiple bets can be placed per player per match.
      <p>
      Our default & minimum stake per bet is 2mBTC (0.002BTC) but you are free to increase your stakes.
      <p>
      Our Chat section enables you to interact with others and with BTCsoccer.com.
      <p>
      The site is registration / login free: we take pure Bitcoin bets and return your profits into your Bitcoin address within minutes after the matches' end.
      <p><strong>
        If you use an online wallet service you must specify your personal wallet address for payout purposes. Profits will be paid out to the sender address if no return wallet address is specified!</strong>
      <p>
      Make sure that you are over 18 years old and it is legal in your country to play online gambling games.
      <p>
      Don't wager any Bitcoin that you can not afford to loose.
      <p>
      The total amount of Bitcoin wagered on a match - minus the 2% house commission fee - is automatically transferred into the Bitcoin wallets of the winning bettor(s). 
      <p>
      An example: The total wager on a match is 400mBTC. Your stake in the correct end result is 6mBTC from a total of 22mBTC wagered on that score. BTCsoccer will transfer 6 + (378 * 6/22 * 0.98) = 107mBTC into your Bitcoin wallet.

      <p>
      On the Stats section you can keep track of a recent history of all your bets, transactions and return payment statuses.

      <p>
      Invalid bets and bets on games without a winner are 100% refunded.

    <h4><a name="a2" href="#q2">What does a 2% house edge mean?</a><h4>
      <p>
      A 2% commission fee is yielded on PROFITS of winning bets only. 
      
      <p>Wagers will be 100% refunded should the match NOT produce a winning bettor.

      <h4><a name="a2b" href="#q2b">How does the game work?</a><h4>
      <p>Select a match from the Bets section. Live Games are closed for betting as the match has already begun.

      <p>Place a Bet by predicting an end result from the matches' Score Grid. 
        Selected scores are added to the Bet Slip from where stakes are confirmed per bet.

        <p>Upon clicking CheckOut you will we presented with a QR code and a link to process your Bet transaction.

        <p>Once paid, your Bets are marked yellow on the matches' score grids.

        <p>In the event of a knock out match the end result is the score after 90minutes regular playtime 
        (plus stoppage time) + 30minutes extra time.

        <p>In the event that a match is decided in a penalty shootout, 
        all bets on the correct match winner will be paid out (-2% house edge â€¦)

        <p>NB:
        <ul>
          <li>betting closes a couple of minutes before the match start. If for some reason your bet is invalidated because the bet comes in after closing time; we will refund your stake after the match end for a full 100%
          <li>MaxWins projected on the ScoreGrid are indicative at the time of placement. Obviously profits are subject to change caused by more bets placed.
          <li> If a match is Abandoned or Postponed, all bets are cancelled and stakes a 100% refunded.
          <li>
          We rely on external soccer data feeds, errors resulting from incorrect data will be dealt with manually in accordance with fairness and justness.
